/// Texture living on the graphics card that can be used for drawing.
///
/// A texture lives in the graphics card memory, therefore it is very fast to
/// draw a texture to a render target, or copy a render target to a texture (the
/// graphics card can access both directly).
///
/// Being stored in the graphics card memory has some drawbacks. A texture
/// cannot be manipulated as freely as an `Image`: you need to prepare the
/// pixels first and then upload them to the texture in a single operation
/// (see the `update()` method).
///
/// `Texture` makes it easy to convert from/to `Image`, but keep in mind that
/// these calls require transfers between the graphics card and the central
/// memory, and are therefore slow operations.
///
/// A texture can be loaded from an image, and also directly from a
/// file/memory/stream. The necessary shortcuts are defined so that you don't
/// need an image first for the most common cases. However, if you want to
/// perform some modifications on the pixels before creating the final texture,
/// you can load your file to an `Image`, do whatever you need with the pixels,
/// and then call `new_from_image()`.
///
/// Since they live in the graphics card memory, the pixels of a texture cannot
/// be accessed without a slow copy first, and cannot be accessed individually.
/// Therefore, if you need to read the texture's pixels (such as for
/// pixel-perfect collisions), it is recommended to store the collision
/// information separately, for example in an array of booleans.
///
/// Like `Image`, `Texture` can handle a unique internal representation of
/// pixels, which is 32-bit RGBA. This means that a pixel must be composed of
/// 8-bit red, green, blue, and alpha channels â€“ just like a `Color`.
///
/// `Texture` can be used directly for custom OpenGL geometry with `bind()`.
