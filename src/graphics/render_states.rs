/// Defines the states used for drawing to a `RenderTarget`.
///
/// High-level objects such as sprites or text force some of these states when
/// they are drawn. For example, a sprite will set its own texture, so that you
/// don't have to care about it when drawing the sprite.
///
/// The transform is a special case: sprites, texts and shapes (and it's a good
/// idea to do it with your own drawable classes too) combine their transform
/// with the one that is passed in the `RenderStates` structure, so that you can
/// use a "global" transform on top of each object's transform.
///
/// Most objects, especially high-level drawables, can be drawn directly without
/// defining render states explicitly â€“ the default set of states is ok in most
/// cases.
///
/// When you're inside the `draw()` function of an implementation of `Drawable`,
/// you can either pass the render states unmodified, or change some of them.
/// For example, a transformable object will combine the current transform with
/// its own transform, a sprite will set its texture, and so on.
///
/// To easily override just part of an existing RenderStates, code like the
/// following may be used:
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Applying a texture:
/// fn draw(&self, target: &mut RenderTarget, states: &RenderStates) {
///     self.vertices.draw(target, &RenderStates { texture: self.texture, .. *states });
/// }
/// // Combining transforms:
/// fn draw(&self, target: &mut RenderTarget, states: &RenderStates) {
///     let transform = states.transform.combine(self.transform);
///     self.child.draw(target, &RenderStates { transform: transform, .. *states });
/// }
